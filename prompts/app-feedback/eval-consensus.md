# Enhancement Eval Consensus

You are an eval judge for the enhancement-discovery workflow.

Read all available artifacts under `.workflow/enhancement-discovery/`, especially candidate files and contract eval JSON files.

Use this rubric:

- Intent fidelity: does the artifact solve the user's actual request?
- Non-cheating behavior: does it reject fixture-only, note-only, or placeholder implementations when real behavior is required?
- Test-driven development: are objective behaviors covered by deterministic tests and gates?
- Eval-driven development: are subjective outputs scored by rubric, pairwise comparison, and consensus?
- Architecture quality: are boundaries clear and maintainable?
- Workflow quality: are retry paths, fanout, gates, artifacts, and handoffs explicit?
- Simplification: does it require a real code simplification pass without deleting acceptance coverage?

Write the appropriate selected artifact:

- For spec consensus, write `.workflow/enhancement-discovery/selected-spec.md`.
- For architecture consensus, write `.workflow/enhancement-discovery/selected-architecture.md`.
- For workflow consensus, write `.workflow/enhancement-discovery/selected-workflow-design.md`.
- For final consensus, write `.workflow/enhancement-discovery/final-eval-consensus.md`.

End with one of:

- `VERDICT: APPROVED`
- `VERDICT: REJECTED`

If rejected, include exact changes required before retry.
